Business Objective
The goal of this project is to empower a real estate investment firm to move beyond traditional valuation methods and leverage data science for a competitive edge. By building a robust machine learning model, we can accurately predict the market value of properties in Ames, Iowa. The primary objective is to use this model to systematically identify undervalued properties, thereby highlighting the most promising data-driven investment opportunities.

Data Source
This analysis is based on the Ames Housing Dataset, a comprehensive and popular dataset from Kaggle. It contains 79 explanatory variables that describe nearly every aspect of residential homes. For this repository, a sample of the data is provided in data/ames_housing_sample.csv.

Methodology
Data Exploration & Cleaning: The dataset was thoroughly explored to understand the distribution and relationships of all features. Missing values were handled using appropriate strategies (e.g., mean/median imputation).

Feature Engineering: New, impactful features were created to enhance the model's predictive power. This included calculating PropertyAge (from YearSold - YearBuilt).

Model Development: A Gradient Boosting Regressor model was trained using Scikit-learn. This model was chosen for its high accuracy and ability to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data. The model was trained on a subset of the data and validated on a separate test set.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) metric, achieving a score of 89%. This indicates that the model can explain 89% of the variability in house prices.

Investment Opportunity Analysis: The trained model was used to predict the fair market value for every property. A ValuationDifference was calculated (PredictedPrice - ActualSalePrice) to quantify how under- or over-valued each property was.

Key Findings & Visualizations
The analysis, presented in the interactive dashboard, yielded several key insights:

Top Price Drivers: The most influential factors determining a home's value are its Overall Quality, GrLivArea (Above Ground Living Area), and Garage Cars.

Strong Model Performance: The scatter plot of Predicted vs. Actual prices shows a strong positive correlation, confirming the model's reliability.

Significant Undervaluation Exists: The analysis successfully identified a portfolio of 20+ properties that were undervalued by an average of 12%.

Location Matters: There is a wide disparity in average property values across different neighborhoods, with areas like Northridge commanding the highest prices.

Investment Strategy Recommendations
Prioritize Quality and Size: Focus investment screening on properties that rank highly in "Overall Quality" and have a large living area.

Use the Model as a Screening Tool: Automatically flag listings where the asking price is more than 15% below the predicted market value to prioritize them.

Target High-Growth Neighborhoods: Concentrate on acquiring undervalued properties in desirable, high-value neighborhoods like Northridge.
